        <h2>Blog post: Dune's Unique Magic System</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="blog_text">One of the elements of Frank Herbert's Dune Saga that makes it stand out is its incredible
            magic system. This magic system, which has a slightly science fiction flavor, centers around two elements:
            harnessing the power of the mind through intense training, and a semi-magical drug known as Spice. Both
            Mentats (people trained from birth as human computers) and the Bene Gesserit (women belonging to a powerful
            sisterhood who train their minds and bodies to achieve superhuman powers of manipulation and observation)
            are purely based on this first element. But the Spice, a naturally-occuring drug on the planet of Arakis,
            also plays an important role in the magical abilities of the main character, Paul Atreides. The Spice is
            known to have hallucinagenic properties that actually give people visions of the future. For Paul, his
            Mentat mind, secret Bene Gesserit training, and exposure to the Spice all combine to give him uniquely
            powerful abilities of prescience. This magic system is both complex and unique, making the world of Dune
            unlike any other science fiction setting.</p>

        <h2>Blog post: Excellent Movie Adaptation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="blog_text">Denis Villeneuve's movie adaptations of Dune (the first book of the Dune Saga) are some of
            the best movies made out of books I've ever seen. They avoid feeling rushed due to the splitting up of the
            first book into two full-length movies, so all the intricate worldbuilding and political intrigue can be
            explored without pacing issues. The casting, costuming, and special effects make visuals both impressive and
            accurate to descriptions from the book. Though some elements were poorly explained for those who watched the
            movie without having read the book first (Mentats, and the feud between the Harkonnens and the Atreides, for
            example), the movies overall managed to capture the feel of the book and preserve the plot and characters
            almost perfectly.
